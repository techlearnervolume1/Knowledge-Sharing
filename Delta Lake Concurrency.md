Here’s a reorganized, easily memorizable structure of the content with emphasis on roles of **isolation level, deletion vector, row-level concurrency, liquid clustering, Z-ordering, and partitioning**:

---

### **1. Key Concepts and Their Roles in Conflicts**
#### **1.1 Isolation Levels**
- **Serializable**:  
  - Strongest isolation level.  
  - Ensures both reads and writes are serializable.  
  - Prevents readers from seeing snapshots that don’t align with Delta table history.  
  - Example: Readers never see data inserted by a transaction that logically shouldn’t exist in the table’s history.  

- **WriteSerializable** (Default):  
  - Ensures **only writes** are serializable, not reads.  
  - Allows more concurrency but risks readers seeing intermediate states that don’t exist in the table history.  
  - Balances **data consistency** and **availability**.

#### **1.2 Deletion Vectors**
- Tracks deleted rows without physically removing them immediately.  
- Key role in enabling **row-level concurrency** by minimizing conflicts.  
- Supported in:  
  - Non-partitioned tables.  
  - Tables with **liquid clustering**.  

#### **1.3 Row-Level Concurrency**
- Reduces conflicts by detecting changes at the **row level** instead of the file level.  
- Works with **deletion vectors** and supports:
  - INSERT  
  - UPDATE  
  - DELETE  
  - MERGE INTO  
  - OPTIMIZE  
- Limitations: Not supported for:
  - Partitioned tables.  
  - Operations with complex conditions or correlated subqueries.  

#### **1.4 Liquid Clustering**
- Dynamically clusters data for better query optimization.  
- Works seamlessly with **deletion vectors** to enable **row-level concurrency**.  
- Avoids conflicts between **OPTIMIZE** and other write operations.

#### **1.5 Z-Ordering**
- Improves query performance by colocating related data.  
- Can cause conflicts during **OPTIMIZE** if concurrent write operations (e.g., UPDATE, DELETE) occur on the same data.  

#### **1.6 Partitioning**
- Divides tables into disjoint subsets to minimize conflicts.  
- Helps avoid write conflicts if commands operate on separate partitions.  
- Tradeoff: High-cardinality partitioning can degrade performance.

### **2. Conflict Scenarios**
#### **2.1 With Row-Level Concurrency**
| **Operation 1**    | **Operation 2**          | **Conflict Scenarios**                                              |
|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **INSERT**          | -                        | No conflicts.                                                       |
| **UPDATE/DELETE**   | UPDATE/DELETE/MERGE INTO | - No conflict in WriteSerializable. <br>- Conflict in Serializable if same rows are modified. |
| **OPTIMIZE**        | -                        | Conflicts only when **Z-ORDER BY** is used.                         |

#### **2.2 Without Row-Level Concurrency**
| **Operation 1**    | **Operation 2**          | **Conflict Scenarios**                                              |
|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **INSERT**          | -                        | No conflicts.                                                       |
| **UPDATE/DELETE**   | UPDATE/DELETE/MERGE INTO | Conflicts in both Serializable and WriteSerializable when modifying the same files. |
| **OPTIMIZE**        | -                        | Conflicts unless **deletion vectors** are enabled.                  |

### **3. Resolving Conflicts**
#### **3.1 Techniques**
- **Enable Deletion Vectors**: Supports row-level concurrency by tracking deleted rows efficiently.  
- **Use Liquid Clustering**: Reduces conflicts between OPTIMIZE and write operations.  
- **Partitioning**:
  - Partition tables by frequently queried columns (e.g., `date`) to isolate operations on different partitions.  
  - Avoid high-cardinality partitions to prevent performance degradation.  

#### **3.2 Examples of Avoiding Conflicts**
- Partitioning by `date`:  
  - UPDATE `WHERE date > '2010-01-01'` and DELETE `WHERE date < '2010-01-01'` won’t conflict if table is partitioned by `date`.  
- Avoid overlapping **Z-ORDER BY** commands during OPTIMIZE.

---

### **4. Additional Notes**
- **Metadata Changes**:  
  - Altering table schema, properties, or protocol causes all concurrent writes to fail.  
  - Examples:  
    - Adding a column: `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMNS (col_name STRING)`  
    - Enabling deletion vectors: `ALTER TABLE table_name SET TBLPROPERTIES ('delta.enableDeletionVectors' = true)`  

- **REORG Operations**:  
  - Behave like **OPTIMIZE** for rewriting files but conflict with ongoing operations when upgrading protocols.  

- **MERGE INTO**:  
  - Requires **Photon** for row-level concurrency (Databricks Runtime 14.2+).  
  - Explicit predicates on the target table reduce conflicts.

### **5. Summary Table of Roles**
| **Feature**          | **Role in Conflict Resolution**                                   |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Isolation Level**   | Determines transaction isolation and potential read/write conflicts. |
| **Deletion Vectors**  | Enables row-level concurrency and avoids file-level conflicts.  |
| **Row-Level Concurrency** | Reduces write conflicts by resolving row-specific changes.       |
| **Liquid Clustering** | Dynamically clusters data and reduces conflicts during writes.   |
| **Z-Ordering**        | Optimizes queries but can cause conflicts during OPTIMIZE.      |
| **Partitioning**      | Isolates operations to different partitions to minimize conflicts. |
